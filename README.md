# ü¶• Salt Stack Bootstrap: Comprehensive Environment Setup üöÄ

Welcome to your automated Salt Stack bootstrap project! This repository contains an installation script and Salt states to quickly set up a complete development environment on your system.

## ‚ú® Features

This project offers an elegant and efficient solution for:

*   **Automated Salt Minion Installation**: A bootstrap script (`install.sh`) that detects your operating system and installs `salt-minion` autonomously.
*   **Pretty and Colorful Logs**: The installation script features a visually appealing progress log, with vibrant colors and emojis, including our sloth friends! ü¶•
*   **Masterless Configuration**: The `salt-minion` is configured to operate in masterless mode, allowing local execution of Salt states via `salt-call --local`.
*   **Zsh Installation**: Ensures `zsh` is installed on your system.
*   **Custom User Creation**: Automatic creation of the `chalkan3` user with `zsh` set as their default shell.
*   **Dotfiles Management**: Clones your `dotfiles` repository and uses `stow` to create symlinks for Zsh configuration.
*   **Modern `ls` Replacement**: Installs `lsd` for enhanced directory listings.
*   **Nerd Fonts Installation**: Installs FiraCode Nerd Font for improved terminal aesthetics and icon support.
*   **Neovim Installation**: Installs the latest stable Neovim from its AppImage, configured for the `chalkan3` user.
*   **Node Version Manager (nvm)**: Installs `nvm` and sets up the latest LTS Node.js version as default for the `chalkan3` user.
*   **Rust Toolchain**: Installs `rustup` and `cargo` for Rust development.
*   **LunarVim Installation**: Installs LunarVim, a Neovim distribution, with its dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:

### Step 1: Get the Bootstrap Script (`install.sh`)

The `install.sh` script is the starting point. You will need to host it somewhere accessible via `curl` (e.g., a GitHub Gist, a web server, etc.).

**Example `install.sh` Content (for reference - the full script has already been generated for you):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ... (full install.sh content)
```

### Step 2: Execute the Bootstrap Script

On the server where you want to set up the environment, run the following command. Remember to replace `https://your-server.com/install.sh` with the actual URL where you hosted the script:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chalkan3/sloth-bootrap/master/install.sh)
```

Observe the colorful log and emojis as the Salt Minion is installed and configured, and your development environment is set up! ü¶•
